This is the first project from The Odin Project (http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)
The purpose of the assignemnt is to deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it.

The goal is to think about how elements get placed and also to test you current HTML and CSS skills. None of the links should work, neither should the search box.  The key is to learn how to "create" through copying (just like drawing). The use of Inspect Element on Google Chrome will be useful in helping to mirror the webpage. 

There is also (at least for me), an application of git. , i.e, setting up a repository and adding files via the terminal.
